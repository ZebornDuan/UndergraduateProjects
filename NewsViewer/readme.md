## Introduction
This project is a simple news view app on Android platform(homework for Java course in Tsinghua University).

The news server is provided by Information Retrieval Group, Department of Computer Science and Technology. However, the server is not always running...

## Main Functions:
- view news in different topics
- search news by the key words
- choose the topics you are intrested in
- collect the news you like
- download the news text
- share the news in other social platforms
- read the news text in voice
- switch to no-picture mode and night mode
- gray titles for viewed news

## Remaining Bugs and Future Works:
- flash back in some high Android Version when change to night mode
- recommend news for the user (now recommend randomly)
